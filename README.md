Problem Statement :Problem Statement: Traditional methods of managing sports clubs often involve manual processes and fragmented communication channels, leading to inefficiencies and challenges for players, coaches, and administrators. Key issues faced by sports clubs include disjointed registration processes, cumbersome match scheduling, ineffective feedback collection, limited visibility into player achievements, inadequate communication channels, and a lack of comprehensive information about the club's background and leadership. These challenges hinder the club's ability to efficiently manage operations, engage stakeholders, and provide a seamless experience for members. There is a pressing need for a centralized and user-friendly platform that streamlines registration, simplifies match scheduling, facilitates feedback collection, showcases player achievements, enhances communication channels, and provides comprehensive information about the club. Addressing these challenges will improve the overall management and experience of the sports club, ensuring a more efficient and engaging environment for players, coaches, and administrators.
